"grammar" of the game:
    {} = structure
    [] = list, assume length is known
    enemy = { 
        name = string, 
        class data = {...}
        difficulty = int,
        point buy value = int,
        rarity = int,
        spawn frequency modifier = int,
        etc...
    }
    level_enemy_pool = [enemy]
    wave_enemy = random from pool | specific enemy | custom enemy function (aware of current level data, wave number etc)
    wave = [wave_enemy]
    narrative = {
        tags = [string]
        waves = [wave|narrative]
        rarity = int,
    }
    level = {
        enemy pool,
        [narrative]
    }
    game = [level]

example narrative:
    basic narrative:
        wave 1:
            get enemies from level enemy pool
            basic point buy with difficulty thresholds (perhaps only enemies with 1 or 2 diffiulty)
        
        wave 2: 
            get enemies from level enemy pool
            basic poid buy with difficulty thresholds
        
        wave 3:
            basic point buy with difficulty thresholds
            boss

    
    more unique narrative:
        wave 1:
            specific hardcoded difficulty 1 enemy and a random difficulty 2 enemy from the current level's enemy pool 
        
        wave 2:
            6 of any level 3 enemy 

        wave 3:
            random single-wave narrative with the "bossfight" tag
